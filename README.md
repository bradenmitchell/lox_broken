# Lox

This repository tracks my progress developing a bytecode-, virtual-machine-based interpreter, implemented in C, for the (albeit somewhat fictitious) Lox scripting language as described in Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html).

Lox is a high-level, interpreted and dynamically-typed scripting language. Lox's syntax is described in [Chapter 3](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html).
